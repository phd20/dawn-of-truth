Ages of heroes cycle against ages of chaos. History often repeats itself but time moves ever forward unto the dawn. Powerful deities and demigods influence the course of events but they do not control it. Fate is in the hands of the individual.</p><p><img alt="The Forgotten Empire by Tohad" src="/dawn-of-truth/assets/images/the_forgotten_empire_by_tohad_daybksk-pre-278a9d5875bda940e0c686b220d82bfc.jpg">

Some make history with their deeds. Others save the world in silence, their names lost forever. But the fabric of the Prime Universe knows.</p><p>Magic abounds throughout the history of Prime. Wizards study it in their towers. Warlocks strike dark pacts to gain its power. And sorcerers attempt to control its natural flow through their blood. The Ancient Weave of Magika permeates the Prime Universe, no longer guided by the divines above.</p><p>Prime is full of mystery. For every record of an event, place, or person there are a dozen that dispute it. History is, quite largely, a mystery. The world is so vast that many never leave the shores of their continent. Even the term Prime is only used by a handful of scholars. Few have traveled from Kandalur all the way to Aer and the Dorgothian Belt. Myths travel of the Everstorm that hides much of the world. Will you pull back the curtain and discover it for yourself?</p><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_prK2" id="where-our-story-takes-place"></a>Where Our Story Takes Place<a class="hash-link" href="#where-our-story-takes-place" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><p>The Dawn of Truth campaign is centered around a region known as Kandalur, though the story has taken our characters as far away as the continent of Aer. </p><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_prK2" id="campaign-background"></a>Campaign Background<a class="hash-link" href="#campaign-background" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p>The year is 307 AN and it&#x27;s been one hundred years since the Starfire Calamity. The world as we know it, has grown dark. Our empire, once proud and glorious, now lay in ruins. Since the dawn of mankind, we warred with anyone and everyone to see our kingdoms rise to glory. Merely, centuries ago, our civilization had finally reached its pinnacle. Now, look around you. Darkness. Ruins. Evil. But it will not defeat us. We look for the points of light in the darkness. We must turn to our brothers and sisters in the mountains and forests. Weâ€™re no longer enemies. But we are hunted. Change that. Show them that we are the hunters. We are the architects of the new world and evil is not part of our Grand Design. Join others and fight to build a new world. Its up to you.</p><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_prK2" id="prior-to-the-campaign"></a>Prior to the Campaign<a class="hash-link" href="#prior-to-the-campaign" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><p>Three hundred years ago, the Nerathi Empire collapsed entirely. One hundred years ago, a brave group of heroes known as the <strong>God&#x27;s Chosen</strong>, destroyed Orcus and stopped the full creation of an artifact known as the Eye of Time. Despite their efforts, they had to use the artifact to stop the worldbreaker Iosphael from destroying the world. This led to the Starfire Calamity.</p><h4><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_prK2" id="starfire-calamity"></a>Starfire Calamity<a class="hash-link" href="#starfire-calamity" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h4><div class="admonition admonition-note alert alert--secondary"><div class="admonition-heading"><h5><span class="admonition-icon"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="14" height="16" viewBox="0 0 14 16"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M6.3 5.69a.942.942 0 0 1-.28-.7c0-.28.09-.52.28-.7.19-.18.42-.28.7-.28.28 0 .52.09.7.28.18.19.28.42.28.7 0 .28-.09.52-.28.7a1 1 0 0 1-.7.3c-.28 0-.52-.11-.7-.3zM8 7.99c-.02-.25-.11-.48-.31-.69-.2-.19-.42-.3-.69-.31H6c-.27.02-.48.13-.69.31-.2.2-.3.44-.31.69h1v3c.02.27.11.5.31.69.2.2.42.31.69.31h1c.27 0 .48-.11.69-.31.2-.19.3-.42.31-.69H8V7.98v.01zM7 2.3c-3.14 0-5.7 2.54-5.7 5.68 0 3.14 2.56 5.7 5.7 5.7s5.7-2.55 5.7-5.7c0-3.15-2.56-5.69-5.7-5.69v.01zM7 .98c3.86 0 7 3.14 7 7s-3.14 7-7 7-7-3.12-7-7 3.14-7 7-7z"></path></svg></span>note</h5></div><div class="admonition-content"><p>The triggering event of the Starfire Calamity was the firing of Starfire&#x27;s Gaze into the night sky to stop Iosphael from breaking the world.

A being known as Starfire was building a magical device known as the Gaze. It would rival the power of the gods. A prophecy led a group that would become the Godâ€™s Chosen on a mission to stop him.</p><p>After the Starfire Calamity, there was a great Shattering of the Arch. Planes were ripped from reality and thrown into the nothingness of space-time. The World Axis was no more. The gods were helpless to save it â€“ the end was here. Yet, something happened. The Arch rearranged itself. The cosmology warped and changed until the Great Wheel was born. However, the Weave, once guided by divine magic, was now freeâ€¦and dangerous. Practitioners of magic saw the new raw power of it, and the inherent changes and danger it brought to any magic user.</p><h4><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_prK2" id="fallen-star"></a>Fallen Star<a class="hash-link" href="#fallen-star" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h4><p>Deep in the Valley of the Gods, a crater shined white hot and debris across the fields glowed with a radiant light never seen before. The trees on the edge of the valley were seared and dying from the intense heat.</p><p><img alt="Falling Star by Sephiroth-Art" src="/dawn-of-truth/assets/images/falling_star_by_sephiroth_art_dbnxyzr-pre-cfeb0e3a748ac81f6aa0d1f7729157e9.jpg">

To the west of the fallen star, the blazing light shined off of a thousand golden helms as the dwarves of Alheim marched proudly to claim the remains to make starsteel, one of the strongest materials known to mankind. To the east of the fallen star, the emerald and silver sparkled in the armor of the elves of K&#x27;ndara Thaen as they marched to claim the remains to make stardust, an ingredient used in alchemy, crafting, and spellcasting.</p><p>Upon meeting in the middle, they would strike no bargains. They would hold no talks. It was a battle and the last army standing would claim the prize. Over the burning and crackling of the crater and fire, one hear the unified clanging of plate mail from the dwarvesâ€™ perfectly-timed march. On the wind, one could hear the war chants of the elves.</p><p>Some tales tell that the Dwarves of Alheim arrived not only with an army, but with a Death Knight amongst their ranks. But the elves had more. A Gold Dragon countered a surprise attack by the dwarves and three legendary heroes defeated the Death Knight in glorious flame and battle.</p><p>The Fallen Star was claimed by the elves of K&#x27;ndara Thaen but tensions quickly grew between the kingdoms. Some say this battle started the events that led to the Great Silence ten years later. None know for sureâ€¦</p><h4><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_prK2" id="the-great-silencing"></a>The Great Silencing<a class="hash-link" href="#the-great-silencing" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h4><p>More than a decade after the Starfire Calamity, the gods went silent. Temples went days without prayers answered. Then weeks. Months. After a year of no word from the gods, the spiritual leaders made their claims. For the last 90 years, we have heard not a breath from the divine beings we once worshipped.</p><h4><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_prK2" id="prime-imperium"></a>Prime Imperium<a class="hash-link" href="#prime-imperium" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h4><p>Kandalur had become known as the Shattered Kingdoms. Travel became dangerous, threatening trade and safety. The religious foundations of the world were in pieces. During the crumbling of these great kingdoms, the Kingdom of Alheim entered a golden age. Dwarves had returned to Hammerdawn, forging a powerful alliance with Hygahr.</p><p>The King of Alheim proclaimed that Kandalur would become one empire, under the rule a mysterious stranger he appointed the Emperor Prime. From one shore to the other, all would be the Prime Imperium. The little resistance he faced was easily handled. Though the grip of the empire does not yet reach everywhere, it&#x27;s only the borderlands where major disputes still occur.</p><p>The Emperor Prime became the sole ruler of all in the Fold and he remains so today.</p></div></article><div class="margin-vert--xl"><div class="row"><div class="col"><a href="https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus/edit/master/website/docs/doc1.md" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><svg fill="currentColor" height="1.2em" width="1.2em" preserveAspectRatio="xMidYMid meet" role="img" viewBox="0 0 40 40" class="iconEdit_2LL7"><g><path d="m34.5 11.7l-3 3.1-6.3-6.3 3.1-3q0.5-0.5 1.2-0.5t1.1 0.5l3.9 3.9q0.5 0.4 0.5 1.1t-0.5 1.2z m-29.5 17.1l18.4-18.5 6.3 6.3-18.4 18.4h-6.3v-6.2z"></path></g></svg>Edit this page</a></div></div></div><div class="margin-vert--lg"><nav class="pagination-nav" aria-label="Blog list page navigation"><div class="pagination-nav__item"></div><div class="pagination-nav__item pagination-nav__item--next"><a class="pagination-nav__link" href="/dawn-of-truth/docs/doc2"><div class="pagination-nav__sublabel">Next</div><div class="pagination-nav__label">Player Characters Â»</div></a></div></nav></div></div></div><div class="col col--3"><div class="tableOfContents_2xL- thin-scrollbar"><ul class="table-of-contents table-of-contents__left-border"><li><a href="#the-world" class="table-of-contents__link">The World</a><ul><li><a href="#where-our-story-takes-place" class="table-of-contents__link">Where Our Story Takes Place</a></li></ul></li><li><a href="#campaign-background" class="table-of-contents__link">Campaign Background</a><ul><li><a href="#prior-to-the-campaign" class="table-of-contents__link">Prior to the Campaign</a></li></ul></li></ul></div></div></div></div></main></div></div><footer class="footer footer--dark"><div class="container"><div class="row footer__links"><div class="col footer__col"><h4 class="footer__title">Docs</h4><ul class="footer__items"><li class="footer__item"><a class="footer__link-item" href="/dawn-of-truth/docs/">Introduction</a></li><li class="footer__item"><a class="footer__link-item" href="/dawn-of-truth/docs/doc2/">Player Characters</a></li></ul></div><div class="col footer__col"><h4 class="footer__title">Community</h4><ul class="footer__items"><li class="footer__item"><a href="https://twitter.com/phd20_kirk" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="footer__link-item">Twitter</a></li></ul></div><div class="col footer__col"><h4 class="footer__title">More</h4><ul class="footer__items"><li class="footer__item"><a class="footer__link-item" href="/dawn-of-truth/blog">Adventure Logs</a></li><li class="footer__item"><a class="footer__link-item" href="/dawn-of-truth/docs/art/">Art Usage</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="footer__bottom text--center"><div class="footer__copyright">Copyright Â© 2021 PhD20.
