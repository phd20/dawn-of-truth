<a href="https://www.artstation.com/artwork/Rb4ED" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Henry Cavill as Geralt by Jakub MasÅ‚owski</a></p><h4><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_prK2" id="background"></a>Background<a class="hash-link" href="#background" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h4><p>Flux is originally from Jeroen in Alheim. Born into a well-to-do middle class family with a strong military heritage. His father, grandfather, and great-grandfather all served in the legion. Growing up Flux was always mesmerized by the stories his father told. He committed right then and there that he would be the best solider at the academy when he went. </p><p>During his academy years, Flux would work tirelessly to learn new tactics and become better with the sword to follow through on his promise to his father about being the best at the academy. When he graduated from the academy he was ranked in the top of the class and had the top generals all very interested in having apart of their legion.</p><p>During the next few years, Flux rose through the ranks to finally achieving the rank of General and commanded several legions. About this time Flux was stationed in a distant land to help end a rebellion before things got out of hand. Once we arrived in these distant lands, we met up with several other legions to form rank and get ready to move on a choke point we had identified. When we set up post we noticed that there was a village not too far off. Our spies reported back that the town was full of women and children and it appeared there were no solider&#x27;s posted in town. A high ranking General gave the order to me to burn the village to the ground and leave no-one alive. An order I refused to give because it did not serve a tactical purpose. I will never forget that General&#x27;s name, Arkreos. I shall take from him what he took from me...</p><p>Upon my refusal to give the order to burn this village, I was sent to a military prison where I met an inmate called the Priest (who was much older than I am).</p><p>The Priest and I struck up a friendship and I learned that he too had been imprisoned for doing the morally right thing but going against orders. Because of our friendship he taught me more about life outside the military such as philosophy and economics. During one of our talks I learned that he had been the accountant for a wealthy royal in a distant land who had what appeared to be an unending amount of money.</p><p>Well when the Great War broke out this royal had decided he would hide his treasure in a remote cave only accessible by boat and unless you knew what was in that cave you would simply go by it. Anyway this royal hid his treasures and only told his accountant (aka this Priest) where the treasure was. Well after a year the royal died of a heart attack and with no heir in place the king of all the realm demanded the Priest give the treasure to the empire when the Priest refused he was sentenced to this prison for life or until he gave up the location. After the Priest disclosed this information to me we decided to escape this prison and get the treasure.</p><p>One night while we were tunneling the tunnel caved in and partially buried the Priest. While frantically digging him out and with his dying breath he told me the location of the treasure. I finally got him out and back to his cell but before I could say my final goodbye the food was delivered the priests cell fearing I would be discovered I dove back into the tunnel into the Priests cell and hid while the chef investigated why the Priest hadn&#x27;t thanked him for the food.</p><p>Upon realizing the Priest was dead the chef went and got the warden who confirmed the death and ordered the henchmen to get a body bag and they would fling the body off the cliff the prison overlooked into the ocean. The warden and his men then left the cell for some reason and left the priests body in the body bag. Seeing my opportunity to escape I took the priests body out of the bag got it back into my cell and then hurried back to the priests cell and into the body bag.</p><p>The warden and his men then came back and carried me all the way through the prison and out to the ledge and started the process of throwing me off the cliff. I didn&#x27;t realize they would strap iron chains to my feet and lock them with a lock... so as they are swinging me back and forth I see the warden has the keys around his waist and as they count to throw me off the Chef comes running outside saying to stop they have an escapee (aka me). Thankfully because of the wind and the distance the warden cannot hear the chef and the henchman finish the count and right before they release me I grab the keys on the wardens waist and take him with me off the cliff and into the ocean</p><p>With the keys in hand I unlock the chains around my legs and swim up to the ocean seeing the night sky for the first time in months. I also see the warden swimming back to the cliff... I&#x27;m not proud of the next part but let&#x27;s just say no one saw me swim away... anyway I join up with some pirates and I earn enough gold to buy a small ship and go looking for this treasure...</p><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_prK2" id="verndari"></a>Verndari<a class="hash-link" href="#verndari" title="Direct link to
