<a href="https://www.artstation.com/artwork/Rb4ED" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Henry Cavill as Geralt by Jakub Masłowski</a></p><h4><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_prK2" id="background"></a>Background<a class="hash-link" href="#background" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h4><p>Flux is originally from Jeroen in Alheim. Born into a well-to-do middle class family with a strong military heritage. His father, grandfather, and great-grandfather all served in the legion. Growing up Flux was always mesmerized by the stories his father told. He committed right then and there that he would be the best solider at the academy when he went. </p><p>During his academy years, Flux would work tirelessly to learn new tactics and become better with the sword to follow through on his promise to his father about being the best at the academy. When he graduated from the academy he was ranked in the top of the class and had the top generals all very interested in having apart of their legion.</p><p>During the next few years, Flux rose through the ranks to finally achieving the rank of General and commanded several legions. About this time Flux was stationed in a distant land to help end a rebellion before things got out of hand. Once we arrived in these distant lands, we met up with several other legions to form rank and get ready to move on a choke point we had identified. When we set up post we noticed that there was a village not too far off. Our spies reported back that the town was full of women and children and it appeared there were no solider&#x27;s posted in town. A high ranking General gave the order to me to burn the village to the ground and leave no-one alive. An order I refused to give because it did not serve a tactical purpose. I will never forget that General&#x27;s name, Arkreos. I shall take from him what he took from me...</p><p>Upon my refusal to give the order to burn this village, I was sent to a military prison where I met an inmate called the Priest (who was much older than I am).</p><p>The Priest and I struck up a friendship and I learned that he too had been imprisoned for doing the morally right thing but going against orders. Because of our friendship he taught me more about life outside the military such as philosophy and economics. During one of our talks I learned that he had been the accountant for a wealthy royal in a distant land who had what appeared to be an unending amount of money.</p><p>Well when the Great War broke out this royal had decided he would hide his treasure in a remote cave only accessible by boat and unless you knew what was in that cave you would simply go by it. Anyway this royal hid his treasures and only told his accountant (aka this Priest) where the treasure was. Well after a year the royal died of a heart attack and with no heir in place the king of all the realm demanded the Priest give the treasure to the empire when the Priest refused he was sentenced to this prison for life or until he gave up the location. After the Priest disclosed this information to me we decided to escape this prison and get the treasure.</p><p>One night while we were tunneling the tunnel caved in and partially buried the Priest. While frantically digging him out and with his dying breath he told me the location of the treasure. I finally got him out and back to his cell but before I could say my final goodbye the food was delivered the priests cell fearing I would be discovered I dove back into the tunnel into the Priests cell and hid while the chef investigated why the Priest hadn&#x27;t thanked him for the food.</p><p>Upon realizing the Priest was dead the chef went and got the warden who confirmed the death and ordered the henchmen to get a body bag and they would fling the body off the cliff the prison overlooked into the ocean. The warden and his men then left the cell for some reason and left the priests body in the body bag. Seeing my opportunity to escape I took the priests body out of the bag got it back into my cell and then hurried back to the priests cell and into the body bag.</p><p>The warden and his men then came back and carried me all the way through the prison and out to the ledge and started the process of throwing me off the cliff. I didn&#x27;t realize they would strap iron chains to my feet and lock them with a lock... so as they are swinging me back and forth I see the warden has the keys around his waist and as they count to throw me off the Chef comes running outside saying to stop they have an escapee (aka me). Thankfully because of the wind and the distance the warden cannot hear the chef and the henchman finish the count and right before they release me I grab the keys on the wardens waist and take him with me off the cliff and into the ocean</p><p>With the keys in hand I unlock the chains around my legs and swim up to the ocean seeing the night sky for the first time in months. I also see the warden swimming back to the cliff... I&#x27;m not proud of the next part but let&#x27;s just say no one saw me swim away... anyway I join up with some pirates and I earn enough gold to buy a small ship and go looking for this treasure...</p><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_prK2" id="verndari"></a>Verndari<a class="hash-link" href="#verndari" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_prK2" id="aarde"></a>Aarde<a class="hash-link" href="#aarde" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><p><em>A monk brewer in search of answers.</em></p><p>Aarde is a Shifter Monk / Way of the Drunken Fist played by Paul.</p><h4><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_prK2" id="background-1"></a>Background<a class="hash-link" href="#background-1" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h4><p>Aarde has lived in a monastery on the edge of an untamed forest his entire life. This has afforded him the opportunity to learn the ways of mastering tranquility while also harnessing the savage power of nature. This duality was an unexpected reflection of himself, and was made even clearer when he came of age and discovered he was a shifter.</p><p>After a long day of helping the brotherhood brew their ales for winter, he found himself sampling a few too many brews and fell into darkness. When he awoke, he found himself chained in the beer cellar with a crowd of nervous monks around him. After they shared the details of his unexpected shift into a beast, he spent the next decade learning to control his form in the presence of the townsfolk, and honing his survival skills through the advantages of his beast form. His brotherhood protected him as he learned control, and in return, he has sworn to protect the monastery for as long as he is capable of doing so.</p><p>As a skilled hunter, he has been able to keep his brothers fed, and has learned to brew a mean ale using the grains and herbs form around the forest. Making great beer has its drawbacks however, and when inebriation sets in, his focussed demeanor gives way to his wilder tendencies.</p><p>He has spent the better half of his life both studying ancient texts and perfecting his physical abilities. Aarde doesn&#x27;t know the whereabouts of his native home, which is an internal conflict that he struggles with when his mind is unoccupied. With his skills now sharp as ever, he is ready to venture out to uncover the mystery that is his true origin.</p><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_prK2" id="ashokan"></a>Ashokan<a class="hash-link" href="#ashokan" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><p><em>An explorer that delves into the ruins between life and death.</em></p><p>Ashokan is an Aasimar Cleric / Grave Domain played by Neal.</p><p><img alt="reading by AnnaHelme" src="/dawn-of-truth/assets/images/reading_by_annahelme_da3rp9x-fullview-ff3f7e9787f925f948cbf04afc4fccaf.jpg">
<a href="https://www.deviantart.com/annahelme/art/reading-610993077" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">reading by AnnaHelme</a></p><h4><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_prK2" id="background-2"></a>Background<a class="hash-link" href="#background-2" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h4><p>The metallic chunking of a pick-axe upon stone reverberates throughout the undercroft of the long forgotten temple. A lone man, tall and handsome, but grimed with a weeks worth of dust and soot, is furiously swinging away at an exposed pit of a stone wall. “Come on, just a bit further,” his breathing becomes heavy as he struggles against tired and sore muscles. With a one last mighty swing he breaks through the wall, exhausted. He slumps against the pile of broken shale to catch his breath and steady his shaking legs.</p><p>A minute later, he picks up a smaller piece of rock. He examines it, studying the fine chisel marks etched during its creation. Without thinking, his brain categorizes its form and function. “First century Netherese, mass produced, shipped from Acteon.” The man lets a smile drift over his face. His eyes go completely white as he channels his energy into the stone, causing it to emit a dull warm glow. He tosses it into the chamber, revealing the details within. The light dances across the surface of this previously untouched ante-chamber, revealing a stone slab sarcophagus. Another smile stretches across his face. “X never, ever marks the spot.” He says to himself quietly, as he makes his way cautiously into the newly excavated chamber. He picks up the stone and uses its light to examine the fine details of the wall.</p><p>After spending a good deal of time studying the various mosaics and glyphs the chamber has to offer, his notebook was filled with new sketches and notes. “Ok, moment of truth.” After taking a deep breath, he uses his shovel as a lever to lift the heavy stone lid off the sarcophagus, revealing a beautifully armored woman holding a sword in one hand a tome in the other. “The Red Warrior. At last!” He reaches down and takes the book, breaking a few of the skeletons fingers off with it. “I’m sorry, my dear, but your account of the fall of Netheril will fill in a lot of gaps, and help bring your peoples ancient tragedy to light.” Replacing the heavy stone lid, he begins to gather his things.</p><p>A raspy, throaty voice is heard in the last chamber. “you…disturbed…The Red…Warrior, now you must…die…” The man’s eyes go white again as he reaches into the outer planes, giving him the ability to see those who linger between life and death. Four, no five skeletons can be seen removing themselves from the interred state. The man breathes a deep sigh, overcome with emotion. Not fear, nor anger…but, pity. “I’m sorry, ancient warriors, that you have not been allowed your eternal rest. Let me guide you to the beyond.” His eyes go white again as a divine, sacred fire dances from his hand to the skeletons, reducing them to dust.</p><p>A while later, Ashokan is basking in the sun, leaned up against a tree, translating and reading the ancient text. Lost in the text he hardly notices as day slips to night and the symphony of the nighttime woods lingers in his ear.</p><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_prK2" id="peddrenth"></a>Peddrenth<a class="hash-link" href="#peddrenth" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><h2><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_prK2" id="inactive"></a>Inactive<a class="hash-link" href="#inactive" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_prK2" id="resen"></a>Resen<a class="hash-link" href="#resen" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_prK2" id="stone"></a>Stone<a class="hash-link" href="#stone" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_prK2" id="blackjack"></a>Blackjack<a class="hash-link" href="#blackjack" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_prK2" id="oke"></a>Oke<a class="hash-link" href="#oke" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><h3><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_prK2" id="tallwon"></a>Tallwon<a class="hash-link" href="#tallwon" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3></div></article><div class="margin-vert--lg"><nav class="pagination-nav" aria-label="Blog list page navigation"><div class="pagination-nav__item"><a class="pagination-nav__link" href="/dawn-of-truth/docs/"><div class="pagination-nav__sublabel">Previous</div><div class="pagination-nav__label">« Introduction</div></a></div><div class="pagination-nav__item pagination-nav__item--next"><a class="pagination-nav__link" href="/dawn-of-truth/docs/timeline"><div class="pagination-nav__sublabel">Next</div><div class="pagination-nav__label">History &amp; Cosmology According to Grinius »</div></a></div></nav></div></div></div><div class="col col--3"><div class="tableOfContents_2xL- thin-scrollbar"><ul class="table-of-contents table-of-contents__left-border"><li><a href="#active" class="table-of-contents__link">Active</a><ul><li><a href="#flux" class="table-of-contents__link">Flux</a></li><li><a href="#verndari" class="table-of-contents__link">Verndari</a></li><li><a href="#aarde" class="table-of-contents__link">Aarde</a></li><li><a href="#ashokan" class="table-of-contents__link">Ashokan</a></li><li><a href="#peddrenth" class="table-of-contents__link">Peddrenth</a></li></ul></li><li><a href="#inactive" class="table-of-contents__link">Inactive</a><ul><li><a href="#resen" class="table-of-contents__link">Resen</a></li><li><a href="#stone" class="table-of-contents__link">Stone</a></li><li><a href="#blackjack" class="table-of-contents__link">Blackjack</a></li><li><a href="#oke" class="table-of-contents__link">Oke</a></li><li><a href="#tallwon" class="table-of-contents__link">Tallwon</a></li></ul></li></ul></div></div></div></div></main></div></div><footer class="footer footer--dark"><div class="container"><div class="row footer__links"><div class="col footer__col"><h4 class="footer__title">Docs</h4><ul class="footer__items"><li class="footer__item"><a class="footer__link-item" href="/dawn-of-truth/docs/">Introduction</a></li><li class="footer__item"><a class="footer__link-item" href="/dawn-of-truth/docs/doc2/">Player Characters</a></li></ul></div><div class="col footer__col"><h4 class="footer__title">Community</h4><ul class="footer__items"><li class="footer__item"><a href="https://twitter.com/phd20_kirk" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="footer__link-item">Twitter</a></li></ul></div><div class="col footer__col"><h4 class="footer__title">More</h4><ul class="footer__items"><li class="footer__item"><a class="footer__link-item" href="/dawn-of-truth/blog">Adventure Logs</a></li><li class="footer__item"><a class="footer__link-item" href="/dawn-of-truth/docs/art/">Art Usage</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="footer__bottom text--center"><div class="footer__copyright">Copyright © 2021 PhD20.
